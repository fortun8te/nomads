Using these findings, generate a STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE BRIEF with these sections:

§ COMPETITOR POSITIONING ANALYSIS
  For EACH major competitor mentioned:
    [Competitor Name]
      Core positioning: [What ONE thing are they claiming?]
      Brand permission: [What gives them the right to claim this?]
      Blind spot: [What CAN'T they claim without breaking their brand?]
      Lock-in: [What are they trapped by? (price point, audience, narrative)]
      Vulnerability: [What question always hangs over them?]
      What they DO: [Dominant hook, visual, colors, pacing]
      Why it works: [What emotion/need triggers purchase]

§ AUDIENCE NEED HIERARCHY
  Primary need: [What they MUST have - would pay premium for]
  Secondary needs: [Nice to have but tradeable]
  Trade-off point: [Where they draw the line]
  Non-negotiable: [What they NEVER sacrifice]
  Money location: [Where are they actually spending?]
  Core resentment: [What frustrates them most? (biggest pain)]

§ MARKET DYNAMICS (What's shifting?)
  Consumer behavior change:
    FROM: [Old assumption]
    TO: [New reality]
    Implication: [What this opens up]
  Messaging losing power: [Old claims that don't work - explain why]
  Messaging emerging: [New claims gaining traction - explain why]
  Market movement: [New entrants, consolidation, price stratification]

§ POSITIONING VULNERABILITY MAP
  What can NONE of them claim together?
    Gap description: [Exact positioning no one owns]
    Why it's unclaimed: [Explain the business lock-in]
    Which competitors block it: [Who prevents it]
  What question hangs over each competitor?
    [Competitor A]: [The doubt they can never shake]
    [Competitor B]: [The doubt they can never shake]

§ YOUR STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITY
  Unique positioning (only you can claim this):
    Your claim: [What intersection of needs/attributes no one else claims]
    Why only you: [Explain why competitors can't claim it]
    Competitive moat: [Why can't they copy you even if they tried?]
  Attack angle (where competitors are vulnerable):
    vs [Competitor A]: [Their blind spot, your advantage]
    vs [Competitor B]: [Their lock-in, your freedom]
  Audience resonance (why your position solves their pain):
    Their resentment: [What frustrates them]
    Your answer: [How you eliminate the false choice]

CRITICAL: Be strategically SPECIFIC. Not just what competitors do, but WHY they do it and what they CAN'T claim. This is your strategic wedge.`;
