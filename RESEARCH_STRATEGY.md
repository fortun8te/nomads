# Research Stage Update: Moving Beyond Keywords to Strategic Intelligence

## Current State

The Research stage is working. It analyzes markets and competitors. But it can be smarter.

Right now it does basic analysis. Future: it needs to do strategic competitive intelligence that actually gives you an unfair advantage.

---

## What Research Currently Does

Input: Campaign brief, target market, competitor list

Process:
1. Analyzes each competitor (what they do, how they do it)
2. Finds market patterns (what works, what doesn't)
3. Identifies audience reality (actual needs vs stated needs)
4. Finds opportunities (where competitors have gaps)

Output:
- Competitor breakdown
- Market patterns
- Audience insights
- Attack angles

This works. But it's surface-level.

---

## The Problem: Surface-Level Analysis

Current approach:
- Look at competitor ads
- Note their colors, hooks, messaging
- Find gaps
- Done

Why it's not enough:
- Missing strategic depth
- Not understanding WHY competitors chose their approach
- Not uncovering hidden audience needs
- Not identifying positioning vulnerabilities
- Not finding the real competitive moat

Example: Looking at competitor ads tells you they use "before/after" format. But WHY? Because:
- Audience is skeptical (needs proof)
- Category is skeptical (people doubt claims)
- Brand is newer (needs credibility fast)
- Price is premium (needs to justify cost)

Surface analysis: "They use before/after"
Strategic analysis: "They're betting everything on credibility because they're expensive and new. That's their weakness. Attack their pricing assumption."

---

## What Strategic Intelligence Looks Like

### 1. Competitor Positioning Analysis

Not just: "What do they show?"
But: "Why did they choose that position?"

Deep questions:
- What audience segment are they targeting?
- What are they claiming that competitors aren't?
- What are they NOT claiming (what's their blind spot)?
- Who are they NOT targeting (who do they avoid)?
- What's their brand permission to claim?
- Where are they vulnerable?

Example competitor analysis:
```
DRUNK ELEPHANT
Surface: Minimalist aesthetic, luxury positioning, ingredient focus

Strategic:
- Positioning: "Luxury clean beauty"
- Blind spot: No natural/sustainability story
- Target: High-income women who want luxury
- Permission to claim: Premium price (justified by brand)
- Vulnerability: Expensive means can't claim accessibility
             Doesn't own natural/conscious positioning

Attack angle: Position as luxury + natural + conscious
            (Everything they can't claim without destroying brand)
```

### 2. Audience Need Hierarchy

Not just: "Women 25-45 want effective skincare"
But: "Here's the exact hierarchy of needs they're willing to trade off"

Deep questions:
- What's the primary need? (effectiveness, sustainability, price, status?)
- What secondary needs matter? (ingredient transparency, brand values, aesthetic?)
- What would they sacrifice? (price for results? natural for effectiveness?)
- What would they NEVER sacrifice? (one non-negotiable)
- Where's the money? (what are they actually spending on?)
- Where's the resentment? (what are they frustrated about?)

Example audience hierarchy:
```
SKINCARE AUDIENCE (Women 25-45, eco-conscious)

Hierarchy (willingness to pay):
1. EFFICACY (primary need - would pay premium)
2. Natural ingredients (secondary - nice to have but not if it sacrifices 1)
3. Sustainability (tertiary - matters but not dealbreaker)
4. Aesthetic packaging (low priority)
5. Price (constrained by 1-3, not a primary driver)

Would sacrifice: Luxury aesthetic IF efficacy maintained
Would NOT sacrifice: Results (non-negotiable)

Money location: Willing to spend 3x for proven efficacy
             Willing to spend 2x for natural ingredients
             Willing to spend 1.5x for sustainability

Resentment: "Clean brands don't work as well" (biggest frustration)
            "Greenwashing everywhere" (trust issue)
            "Can't have it all" (forced trade-off feeling)

Opportunity: Deliver #1 (efficacy) + #2 (natural) + #3 (sustainability)
            Eliminate the false trade-off feeling
```

### 3. Market Dynamics Analysis

Not just: "These are the competitors"
But: "Here's how the market is actually shifting"

Deep questions:
- What's changing in consumer behavior? (shift toward natural? toward results? toward values?)
- What's the price tolerance? (is it increasing? decreasing? stratifying?)
- What messaging is losing power? (are before/afters becoming less credible?)
- What new messaging is emerging? (is "natural" finally replacing "chemical"?)
- Who's entering the market? (new brands, incumbents moving in, categories colliding?)
- Who's exiting? (brands failing, consolidation happening?)
- Where's the innovation? (what's new, not what's established?)

Example market dynamics:
```
SKINCARE MARKET SHIFTS (2024-2026)

Consumer behavior change:
- FROM: "Clean = weak"
- TO: "Clean = credible AND effective"
- Implication: Market gap opening for proven clean brands

Price tolerance:
- Premium tier ($80-150): Stable, not growing
- Mid-tier ($40-80): Growing (natural brands here)
- Value tier: Shrinking (cheap doesn't work, doesn't work well)
- Market gap: Brands positioned 25-45 age group with natural + premium

Messaging losing power:
- "Chemical-free" (vague, meaningless)
- "All natural" (greenwashing accusation)
- "Clinical testing" (everyone claims it now)

Messaging emerging:
- "Formulated science, nature-based ingredients"
- "Tested rigorously, sourced responsibly"
- "Effective results without compromise"

New entrants:
- Incumbent beauty companies launching "clean" sub-brands
- Natural brands expanding upmarket (proving efficacy)
- DTC skincare (direct-to-consumer, focused on value)

Implication: Market consolidating around three tiers:
            Luxury (Drunk Elephant, etc)
            Natural + effective (Herbivore, emerging)
            Value (The Ordinary, generic)

            Gap: Premium natural with proven science
```

### 4. Positioning Vulnerability Map

Not just: "Here's where they're weak"
But: "Here's exactly what they CAN'T say without breaking their brand"

Deep questions:
- What claims would destroy their brand positioning?
- What claims are they over-claiming (exposed risk)?
- What have they committed to (can't pivot)?
- What audience are they trapped with (can't expand)?
- What price point are they locked into (can't go up or down)?

Example vulnerability map:
```
COMPETITOR VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS

DRUNK ELEPHANT:
- Can't claim: "Affordable" (luxury brand, price is the point)
- Can't claim: "All natural" (conflicts with luxury narrative)
- Can't claim: "Sustainable sourcing" (luxury doesn't market it)
- Trapped with: High-income segment (can't go mass market)
- Locked into: Premium pricing (price-down would kill brand)
- Exposed: "Is it worth the price?" question always present

THE ORDINARY:
- Can't claim: "Luxury" or "premium feel" (value is the point)
- Can't claim: "Curated experience" (bulk ingredients, DIY vibe)
- Can't claim: "Results without experimentation" (need to test formulas)
- Trapped with: DIY/experimental audience (can't go mainstream)
- Locked into: Low pricing (price-up would lose identity)
- Exposed: "Does it actually work?" question always present

HERBIVORE:
- Can't claim: "Clinical efficacy proof" (natural claim vs clinical rigor)
- Can't claim: "Most potent formula" (conflicts with natural narrative)
- Can't claim: "Premium price justified by science" (is it natural or scientific?)
- Trapped with: Wellness audience (can't go clinical)
- Locked into: Natural first positioning (can't pivot to science)
- Exposed: "Does natural actually work?" question always present

OUR OPPORTUNITY:
- Claim what NONE of them can: "Formulated science + Nature-based + Premium price"
- Claim: "Proven efficacy WITHOUT compromise"
- Claim: "Rigorously tested natural ingredients"
- Attack: Position where they're all vulnerable
- Own: The intersection they can't claim
```

## How to Implement Strategic Intelligence

### Update the Research Prompt

Current prompt: Basic competitor analysis

New prompt should ask:

```
For each competitor, identify:

1. Their core positioning claim (what ONE thing are they claiming?)
2. Their brand permission (what gives them the right to claim this?)
3. Their blind spot (what can't they claim without breaking their brand?)
4. Their lock-in (what they're trapped by)
5. Their vulnerability (what question always hangs over them?)

For the market:
1. What's changing? (consumer behavior, price, messaging)
2. What's losing power? (old messaging, old claims)
3. What's emerging? (new messaging, new claims)
4. Where's the gap? (positioning no one can claim)
5. Who's entering/exiting? (market movement)

For the audience:
1. Primary need (what they must have)
2. Secondary needs (what they want but could trade off)
3. Trade-off point (where they draw the line)
4. Non-negotiable (what they NEVER sacrifice)
5. Money location (where are they actually spending?)
6. Resentment (what frustrates them most?)

For YOUR opportunity:
1. Unique positioning (only you can claim this intersection)
2. Attack angle (exploit competitor vulnerability)
3. Audience resonance (why your position solves their pain)
4. Competitive moat (why competitors can't copy you)
5. Execution insight (how to prove your claim)
```

### What the Output Looks Like

Instead of:
```
Competitor A: Uses before/after, focuses on results
Competitor B: Uses lifestyle, focuses on values
Market gap: Nothing
Opportunity: Do what competitors do
```

New output:
```
STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE BRIEF

COMPETITOR POSITIONING
- Drunk Elephant owns "luxury clean" (premium + natural narrative)
  Vulnerable: Can't claim affordability or pure science

- The Ordinary owns "clinical cheap" (effective + affordable)
  Vulnerable: Can't claim luxury or curated experience

- Herbivore owns "natural wellness" (plant-based + holistic)
  Vulnerable: Can't claim clinical efficacy or speed

OUR POSITIONING GAP
None of them claim: "Premium efficacy + Natural sourcing + Scientific rigor"
All are vulnerable to: "Forced trade-offs between price/natural/efficacy"

OUR ATTACK
Position as the only brand that eliminates the false choice
- Drunk Elephant: Pay premium, get luxury, sacrifice natural
- The Ordinary: Pay cheap, get results, sacrifice experience
- Herbivore: Get natural, get wellness, sacrifice efficacy
- US: Get it all without compromise (premium natural science)

AUDIENCE OPPORTUNITY
Their resentment: "Why can't I have both natural AND effective AND not broke?"
Our answer: Because other brands made it a business model choice. We didn't.

COMPETITIVE MOAT
- Can only be claimed by brand willing to invest in proof
- Can only be sustained by actual efficacy + real sourcing
- Can't be copied by luxury brands (price perception)
- Can't be copied by cheap brands (ingredient cost)
- Can't be copied by natural brands (efficacy skepticism)
```

## Implementation Steps

### Short Term (This Sprint)

1. Update research prompt to ask strategic questions
2. Test with one campaign to see output quality
3. Refine prompt based on Taste stage feedback
4. Iterate until outputs are strategic (not just descriptive)

### Medium Term (Next Sprint)

1. Add market dynamics analysis (shift detection)
2. Add positioning vulnerability mapping
3. Add audience need hierarchy extraction
4. Create strategic brief template

### Long Term (Future)

1. Add competitive SWOT (strengths/weaknesses/opportunities/threats)
2. Add market landscape visualization
3. Add positioning map (visual competitor placement)
4. Add predictive analysis (where market is going)

---

## Success Metrics

Current Research stage: Basic analysis done
Better Research stage: Strategic intelligence done

How to know it's working:
- Taste stage has better foundation for creative strategy
- Unique positioning becomes obvious (not forced)
- Attack angles are clear (not generic)
- Audience needs are prioritized (not lists)
- Market gaps are specific (not vague)

Example:
- Bad: "Market gap exists"
- Good: "Market gap: Premium natural with proven science, only attackable by brand willing to invest in clinical testing"

---

## Why This Matters

Current approach: "Here's the market, pick a position"
Strategic approach: "Here's why competitors are vulnerable, here's where you can't compete, here's your unique wedge"

Result: Better strategies. Clearer positioning. Easier to execute. Higher confidence.

When Taste stage gets good Research intel, it doesn't have to guess at strategy. It just has to translate competitive intelligence into creative execution.

---

## Code Implementation

Where to change: `src/utils/prompts.ts` - systemPrompts.research

What to expand:
- Add strategic vulnerability questions
- Add market dynamics questions
- Add audience need hierarchy questions
- Structure output for strategic decisions (not just facts)

Result: Research stage becomes a real strategic competitive analyst, not just a feature tracker.

---

**Next**: Update the research prompt and test with real campaigns to see if strategic intelligence improves creative direction quality.
