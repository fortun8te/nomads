# How NOMADS Makes Ads - Detailed Breakdown

## The Complete Ad Creation Process

NOMADS creates ads through an intelligent 5-stage cycle that mimics how human creative teams work—but faster and without ego.

---

## Stage 1: RESEARCH - Understanding the Market

### What Happens
The AI becomes a competitive intelligence analyst. It studies your market deeply to understand:
- **Who you're trying to reach** (target audience)
- **What they care about** (needs, desires, pain points)
- **Who's already talking to them** (competitors)
- **What's working and what's not** (successful vs failed approaches)
- **Where the gaps are** (untapped opportunities)

### The Process

**Input you provide:**
```
Campaign Brief: "Launch a natural skincare line"
Target Market: "Women 25-45, eco-conscious, willing to pay premium"
Competitors: "Drunk Elephant, The Ordinary, Herbivore, Neutrogena"
```

**What the AI researches:**
```
1. AUDIENCE ANALYSIS
   - Demographics: age, income, education, location
   - Psychographics: values, lifestyle, concerns
   - Behaviors: where they shop, what they buy, pain points
   - Needs: what problems are they trying to solve?
   - Wants: what do they aspire to?

2. COMPETITOR ANALYSIS (for each competitor)
   - Brand positioning: how do they market themselves?
   - Creative hooks: what messages do they use?
   - Visual style: colors, photography, aesthetic
   - Tone: formal? casual? aspirational? friendly?
   - Messaging pillars: what are their main claims?
   - Strengths: what are they doing right?
   - Weaknesses: what are they not addressing?

3. MARKET GAPS
   - What are competitors NOT saying?
   - What audience needs are unmet?
   - What positioning is available?
   - What emotional needs aren't being addressed?

4. CREATIVE OPPORTUNITIES
   - What hooks would resonate?
   - What angles haven't been tried?
   - What would make your brand stand out?
   - What can only you credibly claim?
```

### Real Example Output

```
MARKET & AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

§ Target Audience Insights
  → Women 25-45, college-educated, median income $75k+
  → Values: sustainability, health, beauty, self-care
  → Pain points: ingredient transparency, greenwashing skepticism,
     skin sensitivity, anti-aging concerns
  → Shopping behavior: research-driven, read reviews, willing to
     pay premium for values alignment
  → Aspiration: looking "natural" but highly effective - not
     sacrificing results for sustainability

§ Competitor Creative Analysis

  DRUNK ELEPHANT
    Hook: "Clean beauty that actually works"
    Visual: Minimalist white/pink aesthetic, aspirational
            lifestyle photography
    Tone: Confident, science-backed, luxury feel
    Strength: Strong design, premium positioning
    Weakness: Doesn't emphasize natural ingredients heavily,
              perceived as expensive without eco story

  THE ORDINARY
    Hook: "Effective skincare at fair prices"
    Visual: Clinical, ingredient-focused, educational
    Tone: Transparent, anti-marketing, direct
    Strength: Affordability + effectiveness, trust
    Weakness: Not aspirational, clinical feel alienates some,
              no brand personality

  HERBIVORE
    Hook: "Plant-based luxury skincare"
    Visual: Botanical, earthy tones, natural photography
    Tone: Holistic, wellness-focused, earthy
    Strength: Natural ingredient story, beautiful brand
    Weakness: Less science-backed feeling, fewer claims

§ MARKET GAPS & OPPORTUNITIES
  → Gap: No brand successfully combining scientific credibility
         with natural ingredients + sustainability story
  → Opportunity: Position as "Science meets nature" - rigorous,
                 tested formulations from clean sources
  → Messaging angle: Not anti-science, not greenwashing - genuine
                     scientific approach to natural ingredients
  → Emotional hook: Women can feel smart, conscious, AND effective
                    using your products (all three, not trade-off)

§ RECOMMENDED CREATIVE DIRECTION
  → Unique positioning: "Formulated Science. Nature Based."
  → Target emotion: Empowerment through informed choice
  → Key message: "Effective skincare that aligns with your values"
  → Visual approach: Science-inspired but natural
  → Audience feeling: Smart, conscious, beautiful, effective
```

### Why This Matters
- **Competitive advantage**: Know what NOT to do
- **Audience understanding**: Deep insights into what matters
- **Positioning clarity**: Know exactly where you fit
- **Message foundation**: What to say and how to say it

---

## Stage 2: TASTE - Defining Creative Direction

### What Happens
Now that we understand the market, the AI becomes a creative director. It translates market insights into a coherent **creative strategy** that will make your ads stand out.

"Taste" = The specific creative flavor/personality of your brand

### The Process

**Input:** Research output + campaign brief

**What the AI decides:**
```
1. VISUAL IDENTITY
   - What colors represent your brand?
   - What photography style?
   - What fonts and typography?
   - What overall aesthetic?

2. TONE OF VOICE
   - How should we talk to the audience?
   - Formal or casual?
   - Educational or entertaining?
   - Inspirational or practical?

3. KEY MESSAGES
   - What are the 3-5 main things we want to say?
   - How do we prove/support each claim?
   - What's the hierarchy (most to least important)?

4. EMOTIONAL APPEAL
   - What emotion do we want to trigger?
   - Pride? Confidence? Belonging? Empowerment?
   - How do we create that feeling?

5. UNIQUE ANGLE
   - Why choose us vs competitors?
   - What can only we say/show?
   - What's our competitive weapon?

6. CREATIVE EXECUTION STYLE
   - What format? (photos, video, carousel, etc)
   - What pacing/rhythm?
   - What call-to-action style?
```

### Real Example Output

```
CREATIVE DIRECTION - "Natural Skincare Q1"

§ Visual Identity Strategy
  → Color Palette:
     Primary: Deep forest green (#2D5016)
     - Represents: Nature, growth, organic, premium
     Accent: Warm gold (#D4AF37)
     - Represents: Science, precision, luxury
     Neutral: Off-white (#F5F5F0)
     - Represents: Clean, minimal, premium

  → Photography Style:
     • Botanical macro photography (detailed, scientific)
     • Hands applying skincare (relatable, aspirational)
     • Ingredients shown naturally (not clinical, but present)
     • Real skin textures (not heavily retouched)
     • Soft natural lighting (warm, approachable)

  → Typography:
     • Headlines: Serif font (Garamond) - trustworthy, premium
     • Body: Clean sans-serif (Inter) - modern, readable
     • Supporting elements: Organic hand-drawn accents

§ Tone of Voice
  → Personality: Knowledgeable + Warm
     NOT cold/clinical (like The Ordinary)
     NOT overly aspirational (like Drunk Elephant)
     Somewhere between: Confident but approachable

  → Messaging style:
     • Lead with results (what it does)
     • Prove with ingredients (how it works)
     • Close with values (why it matters)

  → Example phrases:
     "Formulated for results. Sourced with purpose."
     "The science of nature. The nature of science."
     "Effective skincare. Informed choice."

§ Key Message Hierarchy
  1. EFFICACY
     "Works as well as synthetic alternatives"
     Proof: Ingredient spotlights, testimonials, before/afters

  2. NATURAL SOURCING
     "Clean ingredients from sustainable sources"
     Proof: Transparency, certifications, sourcing stories

  3. CONSCIOUS CHOICE
     "Beauty that doesn't compromise your values"
     Proof: Impact statements, sustainability facts

  4. SCIENCE-BACKED
     "Rigorously tested and proven"
     Proof: Study results, expert backing, technical specs

§ Emotional Strategy
  Target Emotion: Empowered Confidence
  - She feels smart choosing this brand
  - She feels good about the impact
  - She feels beautiful using the products
  - She feels part of a conscious community

  How we create this feeling:
  - Show other smart women using it (social proof)
  - Explain the science (respect her intelligence)
  - Highlight impact (she's part of something bigger)
  - Celebrate results (beauty + values alignment)

§ Competitive Differentiation
  Our Unique Angle:
  "We're not nature OR science - we're both"

  Why it wins:
  - Drunk Elephant focused on luxury, not natural story
  - The Ordinary focused on affordability, clinical feel
  - Herbivore focused on natural, less science-backed

  Our space: Premium + Natural + Scientific
  (Claim only we can authentically make)

§ Creative Execution Framework

  FORMAT: Photo carousel + educational copy + UGC testimonials

  PACING:
  - Hook (0-3 sec): Striking visual + compelling question
  - Build (3-10 sec): Show product + before/after
  - Close (10-15 sec): Call to action + brand moment

  CALL TO ACTION:
  - Primary: "Discover your routine" (educational, not pushy)
  - Secondary: "Shop" (clear conversion)
  - Tertiary: "Learn more" (engagement)

§ Proof Points to Emphasize
  ✓ Ingredient transparency (list what's IN)
  ✓ Efficacy claims (clinical results)
  ✓ Sustainability proof (certifications, impact)
  ✓ Expert backing (dermatologist, eco-scientist endorsements)
  ✓ Customer proof (testimonials, before/afters)
```

### Why This Matters
- **Coherent brand**: Everything aligns and reinforces
- **Memorable**: Distinct look/feel separates you
- **Emotional connection**: People buy feelings, not features
- **Strategic consistency**: All ads follow same playbook
- **Creative clarity**: Designers know exactly what to build

---

## Stage 3: MAKE - Generating Visual Designs

### What Happens
Now we have the creative direction. Time to actually **make the ads**.

The AI uses the taste strategy to generate:
- Design mockups in Figma
- Visual layouts and compositions
- Actual design assets
- Ad variations (mobile, desktop, carousel, etc)

### The Process

**Input:** Creative direction + campaign brief

**What the AI creates:**
```
For each ad format:

1. LAYOUT & COMPOSITION
   - Where does headline go?
   - Where's the product shown?
   - Where's the CTA button?
   - What's the visual hierarchy?

2. VISUAL ASSETS
   - Hero image/video placement
   - Product photography
   - Supporting graphics
   - Background/backdrop choices

3. COPY INTEGRATION
   - Headlines (main hook)
   - Subheadlines (supporting claims)
   - Body copy (details)
   - CTA text (action)

4. DESIGN DETAILS
   - Button styling (matches brand)
   - Typography sizing (visual hierarchy)
   - Color application (brand palette)
   - Spacing and alignment (clean, professional)
   - Visual effects (subtle, not cheesy)

5. MULTIPLE VARIATIONS
   - Different headline angles
   - Different product focuses
   - Different emotional hooks
   - Mobile vs desktop versions
```

## Stage 4: TEST - Evaluating & Optimizing

### What Happens
Once designs are created, they need to be **evaluated** before launch.

The AI becomes a design critic and performance predictor:
- Does the design communicate the message?
- Does it match the creative direction?
- Would it perform well?
- What could be improved?

### The Process

**Input:** Design variations + creative brief

**What the AI evaluates:**
```
1. DESIGN QUALITY
   - Is it visually coherent?
   - Does it follow the creative direction?
   - Are colors/typography correct?
   - Is hierarchy clear?
   - Does it look professional?

2. MESSAGE CLARITY
   - Can you understand the message in 3 seconds?
   - Is the headline compelling?
   - Is the CTA clear?
   - Does it match the promise?

3. AUDIENCE FIT
   - Would the target audience respond?
   - Does it speak their language?
   - Does it trigger the intended emotion?
   - Is it culturally appropriate?

4. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
   - Is it distinctly yours?
   - Does it stand out from competitors?
   - Can someone mistake it for a competitor?
   - Does it own your unique positioning?

5. PERFORMANCE PREDICTION
   - Estimated CTR (click-through rate)
   - Estimated conversion potential
   - Likelihood of strong engagement
   - Predicted audience resonance

6. IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS
   - What could make it stronger?
   - Which variation performs best?
   - What elements are most effective?
   - What should we emphasize?
```

## Why This Process Works

### 1. **Competitive Intelligence First**
Most people skip research. We start here.
- Understand what actually works in your market
- Find the gaps competitors miss
- Build strategy on data, not assumptions

### 2. **Strategy Before Design**
Many agencies go straight to "making pretty ads."
We define strategy first (Taste stage).
- Design follows strategy, not vice versa
- Everything is coherent and aligned
- Better results, stronger differentiation

### 3. **Multiple Variations**
We don't create one ad—we create variations.
- Test different angles and approaches
- Find the winner through data
- Not guessing, testing

### 4. **Proof-Based**
Every creative decision is backed by research.
- Why this color? (Because the research showed...)
- Why this message? (Because competitors missed...)
- Why this design? (Because testing showed...)

### 5. **Learning Loop**
We don't throw away insights after one campaign.
- Memory stage captures all learnings
- Next campaign builds on previous knowledge
- Gets smarter with every cycle

## What Makes NOMADS Different

### Traditional Creative Agency
```
1. Creative director has a "vibe"
2. Designer interprets the vibe
3. Copy writer adds words
4. Everyone debates for weeks
5. One ad is made
6. Launched, hoping it works

## The Economics

### Cost Breakdown

**Traditional Agency:**
- Hourly rate: $200-500/hour
- Time needed: 40-100 hours
- Total cost: $8,000-50,000 per campaign
- Plus: Revisions, delays, rework

**NOMADS:**
- AI inference: ~$0 (local Ollama)
- Time needed: 2-3 minutes
- Total cost: Free
- Plus: Unlimited iterations, variations, learning

### The Advantage
NOMADS makes it economical to:
- Create multiple variations
- Test different angles
- Run A/B tests at scale
- Archive learnings
- Continuously improve
- Never reuse the same failed approach twice

## Quality vs Speed

### The Traditional Tradeoff
```
Fast = Cheap but low quality
Slow = High quality but expensive
```

### NOMADS Advantage
```
Fast AND high quality

Research + Strategy + Design + Test = All in 2-3 minutes
Informed decisions + Multiple variations + Performance prediction

Result: Professional-grade ads that compete with agency work
at a fraction of the cost and time
```

## In Summary

**NOMADS makes ads by:**

1. **Research** - Understanding your market deeply
2. **Taste** - Creating coherent creative strategy
3. **Make** - Generating visual designs (coming soon)
4. **Test** - Evaluating and optimizing (coming soon)
5. **Memory** - Learning and improving (for next campaign)

**Each stage builds on the previous.**
**Each decision is informed by research.**
**Each campaign teaches the next.**
**Each ad is a variation tested and evaluated.**

**Result: Better ads. Faster. Cheaper. Smarter.**

## What's Next?

- ✅ Research stage working
- ✅ Taste stage working
- ⏳ Make stage (needs Figma integration)
- ⏳ Test stage (needs Vision LLM)
- ✅ Memory stage working

Once Make & Test are complete, NOMADS will handle the entire ad creation process autonomously.
